# movie-seat-booking

This application was built while attending Brad Traversys Udemy course.
This application is a front-end implementation of a basic movie theaters booking page. You are able to pick as many seats as you like and the number of seats and the total below will reflect your choices.

### Design

This application uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using Javascripts DOM manipulation properties allowed for the use of event listeners to assign specific classes to each selected chair. I have also utilized the browsers local storage so selected seats will remain even after a Refresh!

### Technologies used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript
